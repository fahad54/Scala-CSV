# Scala-CSV
Read and process a CSV file in Scala using maven as dependency management and build tool. ScalaIDE was used as it is an eclipse-based tool.

* The solution is mostly in declarative style but I am trying to learn imperative style of coding. 
* I have tried to create function within function, pass function to function and get function from 
function. 
* I was trying to program the solution with no mutability but did not succeed
